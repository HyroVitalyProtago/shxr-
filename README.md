# shxr - Share XR
hmd.link with public rooms - aka you don't need to be on the same network!

- Visit shxr.vercel.app on your PC
- Enter a room
- Paste the URL you want to share

- Visit shxr.vercel.app on your other device (even on another network)
- Enter the same room you used on the PC
- Click on the link to open it!

## Why?
In my XR classes, I often notice students having trouble entering URLs.
Their PCs are wired to Ethernet while the headsets connect via Wi‑Fi, so tools like hmd.link won’t work.
Even when both devices are on the same network, the same link is shared by many, leading to conflicts.
shxr is just another convenient tool depending on your context!

## How?
It's just a tiny express server with not even a database.
URLs are cleaned up every 24h.
